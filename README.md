## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Vue.JS 3 version] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- [node.js] - runtime


## Installation

Dillinger requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd spacevue
npm install
npm run dev
```

For production environments...

```sh
npm install --production
NODE_ENV=production node app
```

Dillinger is currently extended with the following plugins.
